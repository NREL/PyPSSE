# Reference manual

PyPSSE enables out of the box integration for co-simulation and co-optimization / co-design frameworks.

## Co-optimization / co-design with OpenMDAO 

The OpenMDAO framework enables multi-domain co-optimization by structuring the problem as a group of sub problems. ([Ssee OpenMDAO documentation](https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/main.html)). The OpenMDAO interface implemented in PyPSSE enables it to a subproblem in a larger co-optimization or co-design problem.
